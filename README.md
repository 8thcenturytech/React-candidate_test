**PLEASE PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE INSTRUCTIONS BELOW**
1. After you've cloned this repository, create a directory at the root of the repo with your name as follows (first_name-last_name)
2. Create a branch with your first_name & do all your work and also push only to that branch
3. Your project shouldn't have any real data
4. The only thing we are interested in is your ability to navigate your way with codes
5. So you're to study https://freshcart.codescandy.com/index.html carefully and replicate it
6. You don't have to implement any link except the hover and drop-down feature for the navbar and you also don't have to insert all the pictures (just the cards)
7. Just create the structure and add enough information for anyone to easily understand the structure
8. You must use React but at liberty to use any styling library you feel comfortable with (tailwind css, Bootstrap, etc)
9. It must look nice and mobile responsive also
10. We will review your work by 8pm on Friday, so be sure to have pushed your final code before then
11. If you got any help with this task, be sure to keep that help within reach for the 3-months development life-cycle of the project you're being recruited for
